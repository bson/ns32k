Rev5

Changes:

* Replaced 30k pullups/pulldowns with 33k.  Because that's what I've
  been using anyway.

* UART can't use PA0,PA1,PA2... should be PA1,PA2,PA3

* 16C550 AS should be tied to ground.

* ICU RST# (27) should be connected to TCU RSTI# (7) rather than the
  MMU RST#/ABT#.

* Reset too short: make R6 47k

* The TCU ADS# *should* be connected to the MMU PAV#, not the CPU ADS#.

====================

Rev4

Known bugs:

* UART can't use PA0,PA1,PA2... should be PA1,PA2,PA3
  Workaround: replace PA0 with a bodge to PA3.  This moves odd UAT
  registers to offset 8.  So, 0x0, 0x8, 0x2, 0x9, 0x3, 0xa...

* 16C550 AS should be tied to ground.
  Workaround: cut and lift the #24 pin, solder a bodge to GND on C31, on
  the pad facing the "U17" print.  This hack is needed because the signal
  passes through the AS pad and to CS# underneath the package.

* ICU RST# (27) should be connected to TCU RSTI# (7) rather than the
  MMU RST#/ABT#.  Bodge: cut the trace, solder a wire between the pins.
  * ICU RST# should be connected to TCU RSTI# rather than MMU RST#/ABT#, or the
  ICU will be reset on every page fault.  Workaround: cut the trace and bodge
  it to the TCU input pin.

* The TCU ADS# *should* be connected to the MMU PAV#, not the CPU ADS#.
  Workaround: bodge a connection from TCU ADS# (6) to MMU PAV# (44), cut old
  ADS# trace.

* Reset too short: make R6 47k

Fixed:

* Fix address decode bug.  Need to latch on rising edge of PAV#
  instead of falling.  Also need to control CS lengths.
* Ethernet 49.9 resistors see +/- 2.5V, which means they dissipate
  1/8W. We can't use 1/16W 0402 resistors here.  These get warm, so
  maybe use larget 1/2W parts here.
* Fix bug where TCU ADS# connected to PAV# (*facepalm*)
* Route the 32201 RSTI# to the general RESET# rather than RSTO#/ABT#. The
  MMU will pull ABT# on page faults which will reset peripherals!
* Invert RESET# and use it for the 16C550, there should be space for a 1G inverter.
* Change RESET RC to 0.1uF and 1k, cap to 0402

====================

Rev3 Changes

* Fix ICU addressing to use PA1-P6 instead of PA0-PA5.  The latter can't work!

Workarounds:

* Cut reset to KSZ8851-16MLL and bodge it to the RESET switch
* Replace 2.2uF cap with 0.1uF (0603) and resistor with 1k (0402)


====================
