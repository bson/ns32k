Rev4 Changes

* Route the 32201 RSTI# to the general RESET# rather than RSTO#/ABT#. The
  MMU will pull ABT# on page faults which will reset peripherals!
* Invert RESET# and use it for the 16C550, there should be space for a 1G inverter.
* Change RESET RC to 0.1uF and 1k, cap to 0402

====================

Rev3 Changes

* Fix ICU addressing to use PA1-P6 instead of PA0-PA5.  The latter can't work!

Workarounds:

* Cut reset to KSZ8851-16MLL and bodge it to the RESET switch
* Replace 2.2uF cap with 0.1uF (0603) and resistor with 1k (0402)


====================

Rev2 changes

* Ethernet
* Addressable support for INTA/RETI ICU reads
* Fix VUSB divider error
* Reset button
* Soft config switches
* Move USB-C receptacle to back side
* Layout improvements (shift TCU, fit XO)
* ICU pin reassignments
